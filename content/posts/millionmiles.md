After reading “A Million Miles in a Thousand Years” by Donald Miller, I find myself deeply moved.

I am not going to summarize the book or its contents, I can never do proper justice to this amazing book. 

You, dear reader, have to read it to experience what I felt. 

Consider this my notes from the book. All the GenAI images are generated using Canva's Text to Image Tool.  

The context of the book is itself interesting. 

Donald Miller has written a very successful memoir. 

One lazy morning, he gets a phone call from a Movie director asking his permission to make his memoir into a movie. 

This prompts the whole introspective look into human nature and the inexplicable thread of stories binding them. 

## Choosing Stories
We all choose stories, mostly through the unconscious. 

The current story you chose, corresponds to your inner monologue.

Most of us choose bad stories to live out. 

The blame game, the apathy, and the resounding loss of meaning can all be attributed to us choosing bad stories. 

To understand the problem with bad stories, we need to define a story. 

Donald points out that a story is a character who desires something and overcomes a conflict to attain it. 

He also points out that more often than not, we are all unwilling victims rather than grateful participants in Life. 

This observation was very critical to my life. 

I had a long-term aspiration to study abroad, particularly in Canada. 

I made this dream public, told this to everyone I met and worst of all made my self-worth dependent on this dream getting fulfilled. 

I did work hard with preparing for the GRE, looking at Universities, etc., but due to family situations, I had to let that dream fade. 

I blamed all of the misery caused by this incident on my family, I held resentment against them and never really opened up about this. 

As I was reading this book, I realized that I had been living a bad story. 

A story in which life happened to me. I was the victim and I had absolutely no control. 

The first step in transformation is realization. 

I remembered a similar notion from another hugely influential book “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck”

With Great Responsibility comes Great Power. 

It is a variation on the Spiderman quote but holds the essence of a good life. 

At any point in my life, I am the only person who is responsible for myself and my situation. 

I am not at fault for the situation but I am responsible. 

So, I began choosing a better story.

## Character is what he does, not what he says

It is easier to proclaim greatness. 

Easier to show you a roadmap of what I am going to do, and how I am going to be great at this aspect of life. 

But if it is not backed by action, all of it is waste. 

Actions should back up our intention. 

If you know you love your loved ones but never express it, they will never know. 

## Listen to your writer

We all want easier lives, filled with prosperity, love, and happiness. 

All of that without struggle. 

But an easy life is never a story-worthy life. 

It is not interesting and the character never transforms. 

Which is why, God puts us through hard times. 

Whatever your opinion on God might be, we all have some sort of inner compass pointing us toward something bigger than ourselves, Donald calls it God, and I prefer God too. 

God is the writer, we are protagonists in the book of life, trying to fight the writer into giving us everything without much effort. 

God pushes us towards better stories through the Voice. 

We all know the Voice, the inner companion who knows when we deviate morally. It points us towards a better life but we pay less heed to it and proceed to sabotage ourselves. 

We know we shouldn’t be rude to someone but we go ahead and say something rude. 

We know we should ask them about their problems but we proceed to act like we don’t care. 

We should listen to the Voice to live a meaningful life. 

## Joy Costs Pain
Without struggle, we cannot achieve anything substantial. 

We have evolved to seek comfort and order but most of the time we become stagnant with little comforts. 

This is analogous to boiling frogs, if we increase the heat just enough, the frogs won’t notice until they all die. 

We plant ourselves in mediocrity and are too scared to move out. 

## Inciting Incidents
Characters don’t move by themselves, they have to be forced into moving. 

Inciting incidents force us to move. 

We can self-induce inciting incidents - sign up for a marathon, book travel tickets before planning, etc.

The common thread among inciting incidents is fear. 

I never consciously realized that we have to fight fear. 

In the modern world, what we fear has nothing to do with reality. 

It is often inhibiting us from living a good life. 

## Harder the Resistance, More Important the Task

Writing this post had a huge resistance. 

I had this fear of getting judged, fear of looking like a doofus, and fear of misrepresenting a great book. 

This is the dark force that is not preventing us from living a good story. 

We have to break through this force to reach our potential. 

I recently broke through my fear of confrontation. 

I went ahead and spoke with a coordinator at my college office regarding a mistake I made. 

In my mind, I imagined lots of worst-case scenarios and humiliations but to my pleasant surprise, none of that happened. 

I wouldn’t have done it, if not for Chinnadurai Mama and Shwetha Akka. 

If you are reading this, thanks for pushing me. I really appreciate it. 

## Positive and Negative Turns
Any good story will have both Positive and Negative turns. 

Positive turns bring the protagonist closer to their ambition and negative turn takes them away.

Recognizing these turns as they happen in real life is a huge positive. 

## Embrace Whimsy

We are all afraid to embrace whimsy, the feeling that life could be magical.

We all want to be pragmatic or cynical. 

It is much more easier to be in that position and criticize everyone else. 

But the person who does that is too scared to live out their dreams.

Life could be very special if we are willing to take a few risks. 

I particularly, love this video which showcases this concept beautifully.

## Put your Characters through Hell

![4](/docs/millionmiles/4.png)

The only way to truly transform yourself is not through joy but through overcoming conflict. 

The harder the conflict, the higher the stakes, and the greater the feeling after overcoming the conflict. 

We have to put ourselves through hell, to become the best version of ourselves. 

When something bad happens to us, we have to remember that we have two choices: we can become bitter or better. 

Choose Better.

## Great Stories Have Memorable Scenes

We have to push ourselves off the couch and create memorable scenes. 

We all know what we want to do but resistance is holding us back. 

Push past this resistance and create memorable scenes. 

It would involve writing a poem to a girl you meet, pulling over the road to enjoy the view, and making someone’s day great by thanking them. 

## Speak Something into Nothing

Where there is an absence of a story or a bad story, a good storyteller will walk in and change reality. 

He doesn’t critique it, he tells a different story and invites others to join him. 

This point is giving me lots of ideas which we will be exploring in-depth in the future.

## Conclusion
Thank you for reading my review/notes. 

Enjoy the rest of your day.
