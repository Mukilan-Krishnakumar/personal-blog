Hey, I am Mukilan Krishnakumar and this is my blog. 

I have been thinking about writing the perfect welcome post, a post that would introduce me to you along with my personality, likes and sense of humor. I spend hours thinking about it, only to understand that I don't really want to do that. If anything, I don't want to be pretentious in my blog. This is me, at least the version of myself I would like the World to know. I am, by nature, a private person but I find joy in helping people out. I also love honest advice from people who are already doing what I want to do. This blog would be my version of giving back to the community. I gained a lot from my mentors but I have been lucky, it cannot be said of everyone. 

I would like this blog to be my stream of conciousness on some form. I am not going to edit it, polish it, add a structure and publish it. I publish when I feel the need to publish.

I am Mukilan Krishnakumar, I am doing my final year undergraduate (As of August 2023) in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I like to run, read books, have deep conversations with Friends and chill out with my dogs. Most of my days are now spent in doing Internship and I spend the rest trying random things. I like beaches and I am currently learning French.

> C'est la Vie. Bonne journ√©e Mon Ami!
